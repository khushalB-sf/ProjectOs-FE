# ProjectOS — AI-Powered Project Lifecycle Operating System
### Complete Product & Architecture Reference

---

## 1. Vision

ProjectOS is an AI-native operating system for software delivery — a single platform that ingests raw client intent and outputs a fully structured, staffed, tracked, and risk-monitored project. It replaces the fragmented stack of Confluence + Jira + Notion + spreadsheets with an intelligent agent layer built on GPT-4o and RAG.

**Core promise:** From requirement upload to running sprint plan in under 90 seconds.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

| Pain Point | Current Cost |
|---|---|
| Requirement → User Story conversion | 2–5 days per project |
| Proposal writing | 3–7 days per RFP |
| Sprint planning | 4–8 hours per sprint |
| Meeting → action items | 1–2 days lag |
| Risk identification | Often post-incident |
| Resource allocation | Manager gut feel |

---

## 3. User Personas

### Alex — Solutions Architect
Goal: Win RFPs faster, build better proposals. Spends 40% of time on repetitive proposal boilerplate.
**Wins with:** Auto-generated technical proposals from raw RFPs.

### Priya — Delivery Manager
Goal: Predictable delivery, happy clients. Discovers fires in standup, not before.
**Wins with:** Risk prediction 3 days early, automated sprint health scoring.

### Marcus — Business Analyst
Goal: Convert client chaos into structured requirements fast. Hours transcribing meeting notes.
**Wins with:** Meeting transcript → structured user stories in 60 seconds.

### Sarah — Engineering Lead
Goal: Accurate capacity planning, balanced team load. Overloaded seniors, underutilized juniors.
**Wins with:** AI resource allocation with skill-gap detection and utilization heatmap.

### Module 7 — Risk Prediction Engine
**Input:** Sprint data, task statuses, team utilization
**Output:** Risk score (0–100), risk factor breakdown, LLM explanation, recommended actions

**Risk scoring formula:**
```
velocity_drop     (0–25 pts)  — velocity decline vs prior sprints
blocked_tasks     (0–20 pts)  — tasks blocked >48h
overallocation    (0–20 pts)  — sprint committed > capacity
milestone_drift   (0–20 pts)  — sprint end_date passed without completion
scope_creep       (0–15 pts)  — open change requests
──────────────────────────────
Total             0–100
```
Levels: 0–29=low | 30–54=medium | 55–74=high | 75–100=critical

## 6. AI Pipeline

```
Document Upload
  → Text Extraction (PyMuPDF / python-docx)
  → Recursive Text Chunking (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
  → Embedding (text-embedding-3-small)
  → ChromaDB Index (per-project collection)

Generation Request
  → Semantic Search (top-8 chunks from ChromaDB)
  → Prompt Assembly (Jinja2 template + context)
  → GPT-4o (JSON mode, structured output)
  → JsonOutputParser → Pydantic validation
  → Database write-back
  → Frontend notification
```

All AI chains use LangChain LCEL pattern:
```python
chain = prompt | llm | JsonOutputParser()
result = await chain.ainvoke(inputs)
```

## 10. Hackathon Strategy

### Priority order (build first = most demo impact)
1. Requirement Intelligence — **core wow moment**, sets up everything else
2. Proposal & Estimation — shows business value immediately
3. Project Planner — most-used PM feature, visual impact
4. Meeting Intelligence — fast to build, high drama in demo
5. Risk Dashboard — visual payoff, seeded data works fine
6. Resource Allocation — seeded data is sufficient for demo

### Real vs Mock decision table

| Feature | Build | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| AI Requirement Extraction | REAL | Core demo moment |
| User Story Generation | REAL | Visible, impressive |
| Proposal Generation | REAL | Shows business value |
| Effort Estimation | REAL | Judges love cost breakdowns |
| Sprint Plan Generation | REAL | Tangible artifact |
| Meeting → MOM | REAL | Easy build, high drama |
| Risk Score (formula) | REAL | Dashboard wow |
| Resource Heatmap | MOCK (seed) | Complex to build real |
| Velocity Charts | MOCK (seed) | Needs historical data |
| PR/CI Metrics | MOCK | External integrations out of scope |
| Audio Transcription | MOCK (text) | Whisper adds complexity |

## 12. Demo Storyline (5 minutes)

### 00:00–00:30 — Hook
*"Software projects fail because intelligence is trapped in documents, emails, and people's heads. We built ProjectOS to change that."*

### 00:30–01:30 — Act 1: Upload & Understand
Drag-drop `TechFlow_Logistics_RFP.pdf` → streaming extraction → structured requirements appear in 30 seconds.
*"What took a BA 3 days. Done in 30 seconds."*

### 01:30–02:30 — Act 2: Requirements → Running Project
Click "Generate Proposal" → streaming proposal text + architecture diagram + cost table.
Click "Generate Sprint Plan" → Kanban board animates into view with 40+ tasks.
*"3 days of project setup. Done in 90 seconds."*

### 02:30–03:15 — Act 3: Meeting Intelligence
Paste Sprint 3 kickoff transcript → click Process → clean MOM appears with action items linked to sprint tasks.
*"The meeting is already in the system before you leave the room."*

### 03:15–04:00 — Act 4: Risk Prediction
Navigate to Risk Dashboard → Risk Score: 74/100 HIGH → show 3 signals (velocity drop, Sarah overallocated, blocked task) → recommended actions.
*"Without ProjectOS, Priya discovers this Friday. Sprint fails. With ProjectOS, she fixes it Tuesday."*

### 04:00–05:00 — Close & Vision
Show unified project timeline → summarize platform → future roadmap (Jira sync, voice updates, portfolio intelligence).

## 13. Judge Q&A

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Why not just ChatGPT? | ProjectOS is a system, not a chat. Context is preserved across the entire lifecycle. RAG means AI knows YOUR project, not generic knowledge. |
| Estimation accuracy? | ±25% baseline, improves to ±10% as the system learns from completed projects through RAG-based historical comparison. |
| Different from Jira AI? | Jira AI helps you write one ticket. We generate 200 tickets from a document you uploaded 2 minutes ago. AI-first vs AI-added. |
| Data security? | Per-org isolation, JWT auth, local ChromaDB (vectors never leave your infra). Enterprise runs fully on-premise. |
| Business model? | SaaS per-seat: $99/user/month for PM/BA roles. Target $50K ARR per mid-size services company. |
